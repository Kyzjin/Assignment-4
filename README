Reviewer 1

1. Could not get the code to run, but looking through the code I saw no errors.
    Most likely there is a problem with my titanium.

2. There is code written for two windows and is set up correctly.

3. There are buttons to move between windows as instructed. 
    Code looks correct.

4. As previously stated to professor, cannot test in multiple size devises due to titanium emulator issues.
